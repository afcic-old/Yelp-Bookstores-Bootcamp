# FINAL BOOTCAMP PROJECT

I decided to switch things up and instead of the Yelpcamp project, change things on the way and make it about something different.
I created a Yelp-style website for independent bookshops in New Zealand. 

This was a deep dive into recently accumulated knowledge, so it was a challenge, even the help of the Udemy course. 
I haven't managed to solve all my bugs yet. 
The rating system doesn't look perfect yet and the map doesn't show on the website. 

After the bootcamp I was keen to do different project, so I let this one rest for a bit before I try and tweak it and make it work 100% and probably change the design.

It was incredible being able to put something like this together.
