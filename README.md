# FINAL BOOTCAMP PROJECT
Yelp Campsites was the final project we were doing during the Bootcamp. I decided to switch things up and instead of the Yelpcamp project, change it and make it about something I love - books. Since I currently live in New Zealand and always want to support independent bookshops, I always wanted to build something similar to Bookshop.org, I decided to do a version of it for New Zealand. 

## WHAT I USED
For the project, I worked with Bootstrap, vanilla Javascript, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mapbox API for maps, Passport for authentication and using Heroku for deployment.

## WHAT I LEARNED
In short, everything! This was my first proper website. Building out the whole project was a big, steep learning curve. It was my first time using any kind of validation, backend with Node and creating a website where users can add, rate and comment in the application.


## WHAT I WANT TO FIX
After the bootcamp I was keen to do different projects and frankly, even after staring at this for hours and hours trying to debug, I couldn't fix a few things. So, I let this one rest for a bit before I try and tweak it. I had trouble with Mapbox and showing the map and the ratings not aligning propely.

## FUTURE PLANS
The website currently isn't available anywhere, as I am planning on getting back to it in November 2021, having enough time to learn and expand since I first did it, I want to fix it properly and re-deploy it.
